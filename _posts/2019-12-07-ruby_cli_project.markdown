I'm going to be honest - the idea of this project at first was the bane of my existence. For a split second, which lasted maybe an hour, I considered what life would be like if I just dropped out, right then and there. I didn't think I could ever build a fully functional app from a language that was crammed down my throat in a few months. I definitely stumbled across other people's blogs saying how they completed their first project and how they're on their second project and how far they've come and all I could think was "HOW." I know I'm not the only one who felt this way.

I truly don't know how I pushed through this task. I watched a few videos made by Avi and the cohort leaders, and after a meeting with Z I just got to work. I spent my entire holiday week off staring at my computer, plugging what terms and methods I could remember together and searching for the rest. Mainly I searched for how to properly work with an API and pull data from it.

Slowly, things started to make more sense and the path seemed a bit clearer. By the end of the week I had almost the entire app coded out, except it kept breaking every time I tested for input validation, which was not something I had prior experience with, even in the course itself. I had another meeting that did Not go well in my opinion, I felt defeated and overwhelmed. I reached out to a couple other students in my cohort to talk about our projects and see if they could offer advice or guidance.
That night, I got home from work and something happened - within about 10 minutes of opening my laptop and looking over my project one more time, I typed one line of code, googled for something else and found an answer that was so obvious to me after seeing it. 

My project is in its complete, final state right now and part of me still feels like I blacked out the whole time while writing it. However, another part of me can honestly tell someone line by line what it does and why.

I feel pretty good, and pretty relieved. Ruby is an amazing language I hope to continue working with.
